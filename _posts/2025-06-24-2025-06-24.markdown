Pushed my second project’s skeleton code to NNP!

**NNP =** [Narco Neko Playground](https://narco-neko-playground.onrender.com/){:target="blank"}

> **Second Demo: World Dashboard**

I can't be the only one who occasionally feels a tinge of embarrassment for not knowing what’s going on in the world — especially when talking to remote colleagues and clients. I thought this would be a fun way to learn a bit more about global events and geography.

---

> **Project Objective**

- An interactive map to explore current events
- Let information be discovered — not force-fed
- A tool for learning geography (e.g., “Where the fk is Rwanda?”)

---

> **Current Features**

You can admire the spinning globe and find Congo.

Selecting a country shows its flag and local time difference.

Pretty stoked with the progress I’ve made in just two days (after work).

## Tools & APIs Used
- [x] D3.js (globe rendering, interaction)
- [x] FlagCDN (flag images)
- [ ] TBD: One of the News APIs...
- [ ] TBD: Holiday API or database

---

## Known Issues / TODOs
- [ ] Add loading indicator for flag and data fetch
- [ ] Integrate real news (headlines) per country
- [ ] Display full time zone label and use `datetime` instead of just hour
- [ ] Think about where to fetch holiday data
- [ ] Bunch more UI improvements:
    - [ ] Keep selected country highlighted
    - [ ] Background lightweight animation
    - [ ] Zoom or animation on the flag
- [ ] And maybe... an AI button that describes the country
