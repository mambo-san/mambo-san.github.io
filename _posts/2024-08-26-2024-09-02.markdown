>Picking sprite for animation

Found a great website [Kennyey.nl](https://kenney.nl/assets){:target="blank"} to get free 2D/3D assets. 
I've chosen this [super kawaii tilemap](\asset\recording\2024_09\tilemap_packed.png) to be my companion for learning sprite animation.

The excitement of animating kawaii character quickly faded away as soon I created AnimationPlayer and imported the tilemap... So blur like those videos from Japan and pixels from neighboring tiles are creeping in... :(

After dicking around for few hours I found wise word on some forum.

Project-->Project Setting-->Rendering-->Textures

Set **Default Texture Filter** to ***Nearest***.

Yaaaaaas. Kawaii three-eyed naked Santa can now be seen clearly.

The music is from [Tallbeard](https://tallbeard.itch.io/music-loop-bundle). I'll be using more of his loop music in the future :)
