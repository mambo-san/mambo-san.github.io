Unrelated to the recent controversy around Unity's new license terms, I gave up on doing "Unity Creative core tutorial".
- Too much time is required to master Shader & Material for a dude with full-time job.
- Too specific to Unity.
- I only want simple [pixelated pussy](\asset\recording\2023_09\Japanese_pussy_cat.jpg) anyway.
- That could have been a risky click but this website is relatively SFW in case my mom ever decided to drop by.
- I'll revisit this topic when the need arise.

### First impression of Godot. 

Below are my thoughts after completing the  ["2D Dodge the creeps"](https://narco-neko.itch.io/just-another-dodge-the-creeps){:target="blank"} tutorial.

- Godot feels like an IDE and much more programmer-friendly compared to Unity.
- GDScript is dynamically typed with Python like syntax ... and it has **dictionary**... my favorite data type :D
- Not many video tutorials but good documentation + blazing fast built-in doc search functionality(F1)
- The vector Y axis is inverted (compared to Unity). Have to keep reminding myself this is Atari and that **negative Y is UP**.
- The script editor cannot be a separate window (maybe Sublime has syntax/breakpoints support).
- Instantiating Node (GameObject) and accessing node's property is vastly different and not comparable to Unity.
- Symbol suggestion/completion for method names using $node_name syntax is not supported :(
- "Signal" feature looks handy but I can see myself creating a spaghetti code 

Overall, it feels good to develop on Godot and I'll reevaluate once I'm as familiar with Godot as Unity. 

### Bro, September is over, 2023 will be over soon.

Here's the overview of September accomplishment.

![Alt Text](\asset\recording\2023_09\2023_09_progress.jpg)

In October, if I don't get wasted too often, I will...
- Complete [3D Dodge the creeps tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/index.html).
- Explore visually interesting game concepts (no story line, no assets).
- Upload test game to itch.io to learn how to make it playable in mobile browser.

Came across [this cool game](https://ncase.itch.io/wbwwb) on itch.io *5~10min game play*

The method of story telling and the way game gives instructions to the player feels natural.
