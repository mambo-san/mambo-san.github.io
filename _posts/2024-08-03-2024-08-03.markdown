Dear current and future employers, 

I've moved office.

While floating in space, I ponder many things.
- Whether this website and all my digital creations are all just a digital representation of my ego, and that it's no difference to the mass produced plastic social media page...
- When was the last time I visited a website and felt it was "personal". Like one of those [90's HTML3.2 websites](http://www.spacejam.com/1996/){:target="blank"}  with offensive colors...
- Maybe I should call this blog "dev>null"... oh it's [taken](https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/) and the blog is actually pretty interesting...
- To bake or to get baked...

Of course, my team of game developers (the devengers) have also moved:

Dear Nerds,

I'm not being lazy.

I just got carried away adding [google analytics](\asset\recording\2024_08\2024_08_GA.png).

And baking turd shaped bagels.
