Hi,

It's been a minute —  
Almost a year since my last post.

> **Non-technical (personal) update**

I've enjoyed many of the good things Denver has to offer:
- The outdoors  
- Climbing gym  
- Awesome storms  
- Reach Mahjong folks  
- Cheesman Park  
- The *very* strong scent of dog poop on the sidewalks  

But sometimes good things must end to make room for other good things.  
It's time to “visit” one of my homes.

In this case, that means **moving to Japan**—though I have no clear plan on how long I'll stay, or whether I can truly call it *home* just yet.

I'll be in Japan by the end of 2025.  
If you're reading this and you're in (or heading to) Japan, let me know!  
Email is the surest way to reach me :)

> **Technical update**

Created a [skeleton webpage](https://narco-neko-playground.onrender.com/) using Flask and deployed it on Render:  

Right now, it's just a site with two buttons:
- **Button 1**: Game Generator (next project)  
- **Button 2**: Does nothing (for now)

The Game Generator will eventually allow you to generate an embedded JavaScript game using AI.  
I've added a basic “captcha” to prevent bots from using it (since each run costs me a small amount per token).

My next post will probably come after the Game Generator is fully working.

Hopefully I can add a few more cool things before I start job hunting :p
