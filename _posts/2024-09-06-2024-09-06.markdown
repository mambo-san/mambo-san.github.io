>Next project

Recently finished reading the book "Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow" by [Gabrielle Zevin](https://gabriellezevin.com/){:target="blank"}. There were some passage about NPC and thought my next learning project should be about NPC.

>Game concept

- 2D liner platform with some dialog
- Player can "eat" item such as mushroom
- In each level, mushroom has different effect on player (or camera)
- Using the effect, player solved different puzzles in each level.
- Story about NPC gaining freedom from NPC boundaries.
