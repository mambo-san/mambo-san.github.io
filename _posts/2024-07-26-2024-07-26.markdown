Dear Readers,

It's been almost 10 month since I've last posted. As some of you know, lot has happened....
- Doing shenanigans at the beach which felt like a lifetime
- I moved to Denver (CO, USA) from Auckland (NZ)
- Became an uncle
- Bought rice cooker for the first time (shame on my Asian ancestors)

But now I feel settled and ready to make Denver my new (temporary?) home. During the absence, I've been contemplating about redesigning this website so that it can serve as a page to check-in on Takuma. Whether you know me personally, professionally, or through other social media channels, I'd like this dairy to be entertaining to read (with deranged or borderline sex jokes). This is my attempt to stay connected with those that I've met in various time and place.  I'll put the URL to this website on all my social media account so that if anyone ever asks "Hey, what's Takuma up-to these days?", you can check out this site.

Dear Nerds, 

Yes, I'm planning to build a PC around the time winter starts so so I can get back into coding.
