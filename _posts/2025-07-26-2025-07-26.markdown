> Published a new simulator

Since my last post, I've finally brought Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) to a presentable state.  
[NCA Simulator](https://narco-neko-playground.onrender.com/nca_simulation/){:target="blank"} now runs live on [Narco Neko Playground](https://narco-neko-playground.onrender.com/){:target="blank"}.

> Overview

This simulation aims to do nothing... except invite you to ponder intelligence and evolution.

- Each colored cell represents an organism
- Each cell receives a DNA string at generation 0
- DNA defines a neural "brain" with:
  - [x] SENSOR nodes: measure environment  
  - [x] INNER nodes: internal urges  
  - [x] ACTION nodes: move or stay
- Colored area = Reproduction Zone
- Longer time in the zone = higher reproduction chance
- DNA mutates across generations

> Quick Demo

Below is a comparison between generation 10 and generation 100+:

In this system, early evolution is mostly luck. Cells with working brains that happen to move toward the survival zone reproduce.

Later evolution is still luck — just more structured. Those born near the zone and able to hold position survive. Mutated misfits are left behind.

> Slightly More Detailed Demo

This time the survival zone is set to **Edge**.  
Genome length is set to 2 (just 2 brain connections per cell):

After ~30 generations:

Each cell has a **DNA signature**, based on structure only (not weights).  
Cells with the same topology are grouped and colored identically.

Here we see two survival strategies:

**Green cells (move left):**
- `052343b3`: Forward Density → (–1.18) → Move Left  
- `0020dbce`: Bias → (+1.79) → Move Up

**Blue-ish cells (move right):**
- `0a2106a5`: Age → (+2.37) → Move Right  
- `00000004`: Bias → (–2.50) → Self (dud connection)

I hadn’t planned for negative weights, but a bug allowed them — giving rise to accidental strategies like "move left when forward is __*not*__ crowded”

> Even More Detailed Demo 

To survive in a more complex zone like a *donut*, cells need more neural connections — in other words, more brain power. Adding a few INNER neurons also helps.

With more neurons, a wider variety of survival strategies emerges.  
More unique DNA structures = more colors.  
But with complexity comes opacity: it's much harder to explain *why* a cell behaves a certain way without stepping through its logic.

Below is a breakdown of the DNA for one of the highlighted cells in the image


Legend: SENSOR → (weight) → TARGET

- `0722735d`: Distance to South → (–0.25) → Move Down  
- `0712c958`: Distance to South → (+1.43) → Inner Neuron 2  
- `08230918`: Distance to West → (–2.32) → Move Left  
- `0821ba14`: Distance to West → (+1.13) → Move Right  
- `0822bba6`: Distance to West → (+1.17) → Move Down  
- `021030c1`: Touching Wall → (–1.55) → Inner Neuron 0  
- `0310d141`: Wall Proximity → (+1.59) → Inner Neuron 0  
- `10236fdd`: Inner Neuron 0 → (–0.32) → Move Left  
- `1020e6c7`: Inner Neuron 0 → (+2.01) → Move Up  
- `10225410`: Inner Neuron 0 → (–0.86) → Move Down  
- `111004b3`: Inner Neuron 1 → (–2.41) → Inner Neuron 0  
- `1210df0e`: Inner Neuron 2 → (+1.86) → Inner Neuron 0  
- `1210e26d`: Inner Neuron 2 → (+1.92) → Inner Neuron 0  
- `12125c4d`: Inner Neuron 2 → (–0.70) → Inner Neuron 2  
- `12129256`: Inner Neuron 2 → (+0.36) → Inner Neuron 2  

Yeah, nah... Good luck understanding that.


> TODOs ( if I ever revisit this project )
- Prevent negative weights in encoded genes  
- Add more interesting stats like gene entropy.
- Track gene statistics across generations and graph them.
- Add more SENSOR / ACTION node types  
- Allow Reproduction Zone updates mid-simulation  
- Add "Dead Zones" to reduce reproduction odds
