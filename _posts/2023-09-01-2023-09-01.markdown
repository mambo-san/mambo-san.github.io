## Prototype: Pachinko 

Created another [Kusoge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusoge) starting from a simple game mechanic: Count a ball when it goes in a box.

Not bad for a game made in 4 hours (8 hours if you include every minutes pondering about the game in the shower, lunch break, grocery shopping, or while waiting for instant noodle to cook).

The most annoying feature to implement was the synchronized movement of the moving launchpad and the power indicator.
(Did not intend this post to contain NSFW content but here we are)

- The slider values are from 0.0 ~ 1.0.
- The launchpad y axis range was something like 2.75 ~ 3.60.

- I've "fixed" it by applying magical speed multiplier to both the launchpad and the slide.
- In the above gif, the launchpad and slide knows nothing about each other.
- Hindsight, I should have added EventListener on the launchpad so every time slide value change, I can do something like:
	- lauchpad.y = starting_y + (slider.value * multiplier)
