Credit where it's due.

I got the inspiration for this project after watching [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vk7YvBYpOs&t=883s&ab_channel=DigitalGenius){:target="blank"}.  
I also found several browser-based examples online, including this beautifully designed, high-performance simulator: [sandbox-science.com/particle-life](https://sandbox-science.com/particle-life){:target="blank"}
.

So I decided to create my ownâ€”mostly as a way to refresh my programming muscles.

Not bad for a first simulator attempt, I think.  
(The last one I built was a Game of Life implementationâ€”over a decade ago at university.)

I really enjoyed the creative process. It even made me reconsider my career path.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving into the world of artificial life. Watching and reading [Dr. Takashi Ikegami's interviews on artificial life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQtH5KjT0bU&ab_channel=DGLab){:target="blank"} was fascinating. Thereâ€™s way more serious research in this area than I expectedâ€”blending science, art, and philosophy.

During my research, I also stumbled upon [this simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk&t=2512s&ab_channel=davidrandallmiller){:target="blank"}
, which sparked the idea of defining particle behavior using simple DNA-like rule structures.  
My [next project](https://narco-neko-playground.onrender.com/nca_simulation/){:target="blank"}
 explores that ideaâ€”a neural cellular automaton simulator I'm "vibe coding" in JavaScript. I've got the basic framework ready but needs lot more refactoring and algorithm checks, before I start fine tuning the rules. 

I might actually learn a thing or two about optimizing rule definitions, emergent intelligence, and what it means to *measure* intelligence.

### TODO: Particle Simulator
- [ ] Add zoom and follow-cell functionality
- [ ] Performance tuning to support 1,000 particles across 5 types at 30 FPS

### TODO: Neural Cellular Automaton
- [ ] Fix bug where mutation creates invalid neural network.
- [ ] Count how long a cell stays in the survival zone (used as a fitness/reward bias)
- [ ] Study the optimal mutation rate that supports adaptation to environmental changes
