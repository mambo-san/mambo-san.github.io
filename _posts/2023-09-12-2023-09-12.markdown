### Donut

After learning the basics of Unity. I thought the next logical step was to learn the basics of Blender. Since I eat pink donuts regularly, it is my fate to try out the [Blender Beginner Donut Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgFX8ZsChQVQsuDSjEqdWMAD){:target="blank"}.

The tutorial was easy to follow until it wasn't.
E.g. Pressing wrong shortcut key and needing to google how to get back to the view port.

This is the point where I realized my new fetish: **polygons** and **wire-mesh**. 

I've been zooming in and out, fascinated by the structure.

I feel like I'm missing a punch line here...I just can't put my finger on it.

- The reference image on the left top is the [pink donut](https://www.countdown.co.nz/shop/productdetails?stockcode=760505){:target="blank"} that I've been addicted to for the past year.

Oh... just look at that thick icing erupting from the center.

Hmmmm. The punch line seems to be on tip of my tongue.

The last half of the tutorial was not relevant to how I'm gonna be using Blender but it might come in handy when I want to record a demo video.

Ah, yes. The punch line... [I think it came to me](https://youtu.be/ADrBo7u3tR4?t=105){:target="blank"} ‚ù§
