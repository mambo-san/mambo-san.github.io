The key object of the 3D tutorial is to learn:
- Player control 
- Spawning enemies with some randomness (location/direction/speed)
- Deleting objects when out of screen
- Mechanics to squash enemies
- How UI's are handle in Godot
- General debugging technique using Godot

Godot engine's "animation editor" is surprisingly easy to use. E.g. NPC movements to 3D models.

Is it just me or is Godot's sample character for the 3D tutorial looks like a tentacle beast from some kid's nightmare after consuming [too much Hentai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dream_of_the_Fisherman%27s_Wife){:target="blank"}.

[Here's](https://narco-neko.itch.io/godot-3d-tutorial){:target="blank"} the half ass completed 3D tutorial game you can play (PC only). I'm starting to think Godot is easier to implement game mechanics compare to Unity. Unity is easier to model 3D objects but cumbersome when implementing simple object interactions.

>September Goal

Create one random game with shitty graphics. I've been doing whiteboard sessions to brain storm ideas for some easy game to develop. [Here's](\asset\recording\2024_08\2024_08_game_idea.jpg) my best idea so far. 

And don't judge me for my slow progress, I've also been learning how to bake [gnarly looking bread](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-dGKe7xOkw/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==).
