Since my last post in September, no significant progress on [The Life of NPC](https://narco-neko.itch.io/life-of-npc?secret=XB6xpQJWfHxdFchMArPz7qLwr0) development. I have been procrastinating by watching quite a few inspirational videos from [Sakurai-sensei](https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_jp) (Producer of Kirby/Smash Brothers). Good reminder that consuming creative content is so much easier than creating the content. I also missed writing in digital format, so here I am. 

September/October has been pretty chill (vibe and temperature wise). Most of my free time was spent on my other hobbies. 
Summary of Baking and cooking:

Not much happened on Halloween, other than going to the usual bouldering gym as Kawaii axolotl.

Experienced first decent snow in Denver. Glad I bought hiking boots.

I won't complain about the snow tho... I got to see the infamous American surveillance bot: the squirrel. This one seems to be planting a spying device in the public park. This latest model can even cover the device with snow.

And yes, and Cheeto is doing fine. He knows how to stay warm.

- Why do we laugh?
- Does anyone use RSS feed anymore?
- To bake or to get baked and bake.
