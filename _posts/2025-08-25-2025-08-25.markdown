When in Rome, [do as the Romans do](https://bigthink.com/the-past/history-of-drugs-ancient-greece-rome/)

There is a similar proverb in Japanese: 郷に入っては郷に従え。
This proverb was first mentioned in [童子教](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%AB%A5%E5%AD%90%E6%95%99) written during Kamakura period (1377).
It's a short book that talks about morals and manners. And surprisingly, the core values mentioned in this book still can be seen in Japan to this day. 

Here are some interesting ones:
- Do not answer unless asked, and listen humbly when someone speaks.
- Be quiet in front of graves. Get out of your rickshaw in front of shrines.
- The tongue can ruin a person, so be careful with your speech.
- Fortune and disaster do not come from heaven but from one’s own actions.
- A father’s kindness is higher than mountains; a mother’s virtue is deeper than the sea.
- Respect your teachers and treasure every learning opportunity.
- Let go of desire and attachment, and accumulate good deeds.
- There are many rules and manners in this world, and following them is important.

And...
- Bow three times to the Buddha, the teachings, and the monks.
- Bow twice at shrines.
- Bow once to acquaintances.
- Bow sincerely to teachers and elders.

郷に入っては郷に従え。
もうすぐ帰国する直前の自分からしては、解釈の難しい言葉だ。
僕にとって日本は故郷でもあり、海外でもある。
「日本」とは距離感が掴めない柔らかい概念。

１５年ぶりに自分の「日本人らしさ」を出すのは不安も多いが、出来るだけ「海外長いから」を言い訳にしない事を心がけようと思う。
今回の帰国は日本人であることの意味を再認識する有意義な旅にしようと思う。
